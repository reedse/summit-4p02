# Twitter Authentication Setup Guide

## Problem
The Twitter/X authentication was failing with the error:
```
"error": "Token request failed with code 403, response was '<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?><errors><error code=\"415\">Callback URL not approved for this client application. Approved callback URLs can be adjusted in your application settings</error></errors>'."
```

## Solution
This error occurs because the callback URL used in the application is not registered in the Twitter Developer Portal. Follow these steps to fix it:

1. Log in to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
2. Navigate to your Twitter app
3. Go to Settings > User authentication settings
4. Add the following URL to the "Callback URLs" section:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/post-system
   ```
5. Save your changes

## Code Changes Made
1. Updated the callback URL in `twitter_api.py` to redirect back to the post-system page
2. Added code to handle the OAuth callback in the TwitterAuth component
3. Ensured the same callback URL is used consistently throughout the application

## How It Works
1. When a user clicks "Connect with Twitter", they are redirected to Twitter's authentication page
2. After authenticating, Twitter redirects back to `http://localhost:3000/post-system` with OAuth tokens
3. The TwitterAuth component detects these tokens in the URL and completes the authentication process
4. The user remains on the post-system page with their Twitter account now connected

## Testing
After making these changes and updating your Twitter Developer Portal settings, the "Connect with Twitter" button should work correctly.

## Additional Notes
- If you're deploying to production, you'll need to add your production URL as an additional callback URL in the Twitter Developer Portal
- Make sure your Twitter app has the correct permissions (Read and Write) enabled
- The Twitter API v2 requires OAuth 2.0 for some endpoints, but this application is using OAuth 1.0a which is still supported

## Troubleshooting
If you continue to experience issues:
1. Check the browser console for any errors
2. Verify that your Twitter API keys are correct
3. Ensure that your Twitter app is in the correct project and has the necessary permissions
4. Check that the callback URL in the code exactly matches what's registered in the Twitter Developer Portal
