# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Name
AI-Powered Newsletter and Social Media Content Generator

## Description
A SaaS platform that allows users to automatically collect, curate, and summarize news or articles based on specified sources, keywords, or topics. It generates newsletter-ready content and social media posts for various platforms, complete with scheduling, templates, and multi-channel publishing capabilities.

## Main Features
1. **User Registration & Authentication**
   - Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profile.
2. **Custom News Aggregation**
   - Users specify news sources (RSS feeds, links) or keywords to fetch and filter articles automatically.
3. **AI Summarization**
   - Integrates with OpenAI API to summarize articles, generating concise text for newsletters or social media.
4. **Template Management & Rich Text Editing**
   - Users can create or edit newsletter templates or social media posts with a rich text editor (Draft.js).
5. **Scheduling & Automation**
   - Automated scheduling to post or send newsletters periodically.
6. **Dashboard**
   - Centralized view for users to see collected articles, edit drafts, and track recent activity.
7. **Multi-Channel Publishing**
   - Allows export or direct posting to social media platforms (initially, this might be a basic "export to text" feature, later, integrate platform APIs).

## Additional Features
1. **History / Revision Tracking**
   - Users can view past newsletters, previous versions of content, or social media posts.
2. **Analytics & Metrics**
   - Basic insights (e.g., email open rates, social engagement stats) for continuous improvement.
3. **User Preferences**
   - Manage language, topics, content length, and brand style settings for consistent output.
4. **Advanced Customization**
   - Add design components or branding assets (logos, colour schemes) to newsletters and posts.
5. **API Integration (Future)**
   - Allow third parties or enterprise clients to plug into the platform programmatically (Pro feature).

## User Stories
1. **As a New User**, I want to sign up and log in securely so that I can access the platform's features.
2. **As a Content Marketer**, I want to add my favourite RSS feeds or news links so that the system can automatically fetch relevant articles.
3. **As a Social Media Manager**, I want the platform to generate AI summaries for posts, so I can quickly publish engaging content to multiple channels.
4. **As a Newsletter Editor**, I want to schedule my newsletters weekly, so that they go out automatically to subscribers without manual intervention.
5. **As a User**, I want to customize or design the email template, so that it reflects my brand's look and feel.
6. **As a User**, I want to review my posting or newsletter history, so I can track which content has already been sent out.

## Engineering Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **User Management & Authentication**
   - Secure user registration, login, and logout (via Flask-Login).
   - Unique accounts to store personal preferences (sources, keywords, etc.).
2. **Custom News Aggregation**
   - Fetch articles from external sources (RSS feeds, URLs) or using keywords/topics.
   - Store fetched articles in a database (SQLite for MVP).
   - Handle duplicates (i.e., do not re-fetch or store the same article multiple times).
3. **AI Summarization & Content Generation**
   - Integrate with the OpenAI API to summarize, rephrase, or generate short/long-form text.
   - Display AI-generated summaries or content in a user-friendly format.
4. **Rich Text Editing & Template Management**
   - Provide a rich text editor (Draft.js) for customizing newsletter or social post content.
   - Allow saving and reusing template layouts (e.g., brand-styled newsletters, social media post formats).
5. **Scheduling & Automation**
   - Allow users to schedule content generation and distribution (newsletter sending or social post creation) at specified intervals.
6. **Dashboard & Content History**
   - Provide a dashboard where users can view recent activity, curated articles, or generated drafts.
   - Allow users to see previously created newsletters or social media posts (History page).
7. **Multi-Channel Publishing (Basic)**
   - Allow for generating content ready for multiple platforms (e.g., text format for Twitter, HTML email for newsletters).
   - (Future enhancement) This could include direct publishing via each platform's API.
8. **Responsive Front-End**
   - The front-end (React, Material UI) must be responsive and accessible from modern desktop and mobile browsers.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Fetch and summarize articles within a reasonable time (e.g., a few seconds per request).
   - Handle moderate concurrency (multiple users pulling content simultaneously).
2. **Scalability & Modularity**
   - Built in a way that allows switching the database from SQLite to a more robust system (e.g., PostgreSQL) if usage grows.
   - The AI integration (OpenAI API) should be modular so it can be swapped or extended with other NLP/LLM services in the future.
3. **Reliability**
   - The aggregator and summarization services must reliably run without crashing, even if certain sources or APIs fail.
   - The scheduling feature must handle unexpected downtime or restarts without losing track of queued tasks.
4. **Security**
   - Protect user data with secure authentication and password hashing (Flask-Login, HTTPS, etc.).
   - Store secrets (OpenAI API key, database credentials) in environment variables or a secure location.
   - Prevent unauthorized access to user accounts and avoid exposing sensitive data (like personal email lists).
5. **Maintainability**
   - Code must be well-documented; particularly the AI integration logic and data flow.
   - Project structure (React front-end + Flask back-end) must be clear and organized, enabling future developers to iterate on new features.
6. **Testability**
   - Include unit tests and integration tests (front-end with React Testing Library or Jest; back-end with pytest or unittest).
   - Key workflows (e.g., user signup, article aggregation, AI summarization) must be covered by automated tests.
