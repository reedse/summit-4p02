# AI Summary Implementation Log

## [March 7, 2024] - Session #1

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Migrated from OpenAI API to Google's Gemini API
- [x] Updated documentation to reflect the API change
- [x] Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies
- [x] Configured environment variables for Gemini API

### Files Modified
- `website/views.py` - Replaced OpenAI client with Gemini API integration
- `requirements.txt` - Replaced openai package with google-generativeai
- `documentation/ai-summary/feature.md` - Updated all references from OpenAI to Gemini
- `documentation/ai-summary/tasks.md` - Updated all references from OpenAI to Gemini
- `documentation/prd.md` - Updated all references from OpenAI to Gemini
- `documentation/frontend.md` - Updated all references from OpenAI to Gemini
- `documentation/backend.md` - Updated all references from OpenAI to Gemini

### Implementation Notes
- Switched from OpenAI's API to Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model for improved performance and cost efficiency
- Modified the API initialization process to use `google.generativeai` instead of the OpenAI client
- Updated the `/api/summarize` endpoint to use Gemini's API format:
  - Changed from message-based format to a single prompt string
  - Updated response handling to extract text from `response.text` instead of `response.choices[0].message.content`
  - Maintained the same parameters (length, tone) for consistent user experience
- Updated error handling and logging to reference Gemini instead of OpenAI
- Ensured the caching mechanism continues to work with the new API implementation
- Added a new task in the documentation for creating a Gemini API integration guide

### Technical Differences
- **API Initialization**:
  - Before: `client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))`
  - After: `genai.configure(api_key=os.getenv('GEMINI_API_KEY'))` and `model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash')`
- **API Call Format**:
  - Before: Used structured messages array with system and user roles
  - After: Uses a single prompt string with instructions and content combined
- **Response Handling**:
  - Before: `response.choices[0].message.content`
  - After: `response.text`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - Updated from `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `GEMINI_API_KEY`
